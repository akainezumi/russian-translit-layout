# Russian translit

## Description 
The goal of this keyboard layout is to reproduce the behaviour of the website **translit.ru**, but within the system and without the use of third-party plugins, on **MacOS**.

While in standard Russian layout, pressing the keys "**privet**" will produce "**зкшмуе**" which doesn't mean anything.

Using this layout, you will be able to type "**privet**" on your keyboard and obtain "**привет**".
Several combinations are possible, such as **ja** for **я**, **sh** for **ш**, **shh** for **щ**, and more, available on the website.

## How to install

- Clone this project : ```git clone https://github.com/akainezumi/russian-translit-layout.git```
- Copy the ```russianTranslit.bundle``` folder to ```/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/```
- Reboot. 

The layout will be available in the "Others" section when adding a new input source.
